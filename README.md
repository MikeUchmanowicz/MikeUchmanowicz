I'm Michal Uchmanowicz, a software developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and scalable internal tooling.
I earned my B.S. in Software Development from Grand Canyon University with a 3.97 GPA and a passion for building efficient, reliable systems — from Dockerized webapps on AWS to embedded systems experiments.
Currently, I serve as one of two developers at Hoffenmer Inc., where I architect and maintain a comprehensive internal platform for managing DOT compliance workflows, client communication, and automation.
My stacks generally include Python, FastAPI, Django, Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, and AWS — and I'm always eager to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

Outside of work, I run a car customization side business at <a href="https://endlesscustoms.co" target="_blank">Endless Customs Co</a>, where I wrench on my ~650hp single-turbo E93 BMW 335i powered by a Precision 6266 and E85.
I'm mechanically savvy, detail-obsessed, and hands-on — whether it's software or hardware.
I also enjoy basketball, reggae music, and diving into topics like machine learning and embedded tech. 
Recently i've purchased an insta360 x3 and have been diving into the world of 360 video production.
